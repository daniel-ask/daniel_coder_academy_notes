# Rails Introduction

Welcome to term 2


## Model View Controller

- Software design pattern
- Useful for any app or software with some kind of user interface.
- Software are broken down into 3 parts the Model, Controller, and the View.
- Each part has specific role.
  - Models - Will mostly handle the data.
  - Views - Will handle anything that is displayed to the user
  - Controller - Handles any logic and manages communications between the view and model.
- View and Models generally should not interact directly
- Using MVC helps us separate our code and concern leaving our code much easier to maintain and more modular.


## Rails Intro

Rails employs the MVC pattern for us and is inbuilt into the framework.

- Set up rails
- Have a quick overview of the file structures focusing the important parts
- Maybe show an example of a more developed rails app
